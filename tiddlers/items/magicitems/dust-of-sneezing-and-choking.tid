Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be [[Dust of Disappearance]], and an [[Identify]] spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.

When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a <<save Con 15>> or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is [[Incapacitated]] and [[Suffocating]]. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The [[Lesser Restoration]] spell can also end the effect on a creature.
